# Autonomous Supervisor Trace

This document explains the autonomous supervisor layer added to the VET/VTO workforce forecasting system.

The autonomous supervisor does not replace the XGBoost forecast, LangGraph operational workflow, or agentic AI explanation. Instead, it reviews the completed operational state, confirms guardrail status, assigns a final recommendation, records the risk level, and stores a transparent trace of the decision path.

## Purpose

The purpose of the autonomous supervisor is to make the staffing decision workflow more controlled, transparent, and suitable for human review.

The supervisor answers:

- Did the operational workflow complete successfully?
- Was a forecast summary produced?
- Was a staffing recommendation produced?
- Did the guardrail review pass?
- What final recommendation should be shown?
- What risk level should be attached to the recommendation?
- What trace explains how the final output was produced?

## Example Trace

Supervisor started autonomous VET/VTO workflow.
Forecast output detected from forecasting node.
Staffing recommendation detected from staffing node.
Supervisor detected mixed staffing pattern: 1 VET week(s) and 2 VTO week(s).
Risk level detected from risk node: Low.
Supervisor guardrail review passed.
Autonomous summary generated for human review.
Supervisor completed autonomous VET/VTO workflow.

## Example Supervisor Output

Final Recommendation: MIXED
Guardrail Status: Passed
Risk Level: Low

## Mixed Staffing Logic

The supervisor checks whether the forecast contains both VET and VTO weeks.

If both VET and VTO weeks exist, the supervisor assigns:
MIXED
because the system should preserve targeted VET coverage for the peak-demand week while using selective VTO during lower-demand weeks.

## Human-in-the-Loop Design

The autonomous supervisor is a decision-support layer.

It does not automatically execute staffing actions. Final staffing decisions should be reviewed by a human operations manager using current site conditions, attendance, labor policy, safety requirements, and business constraints.

## Why This Matters

The trace makes the autonomous workflow explainable. It shows how the system moved from forecast output to staffing recommendation to guardrail review to final supervisor-approved decision.

This helps demonstrate that the project is not a black-box AI system. It is a traceable, human-in-the-loop autonomous workforce planning workflow.
